Description: Find ping-pong signatures like a pro
 Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs,
 predominantly active in the germ line. There, they limit the detrimental
 effect of transposons on the genome. They do so by forming a complex with
 Piwi proteins. The complex binds and then cleaves mRNA molecules of active
 transposons. The resulting mRNA fragments induce the production of more
 piRNAs, thus reinforcing the anti-trans-poson response in a feed-forward
 loop called the "ping-pong cycle".
 A key question in ping-pong cycle research is identification of piRNAs
 which are amplified through the cycle. PingPongPro is a command-line tool
 for detecting ping-pong cycle activity in piRNA-Seq data.
