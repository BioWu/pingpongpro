Description: Find ping-pong signatures like a pro
 PingPongPro scans piRNA-Seq data for signs of ping-pong cycle activity. The 
 ping-pong cycle produces piRNA molecules with complementary 5'-ends. These 
 molecules appear as stacks of aligned reads whose 5'-ends overlap with the 
 5'-ends of reads on the opposite strand by exactly 10 bases.
